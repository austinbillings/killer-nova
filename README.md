# Killer Nova 🀄️

![Screenshot of Killer Nova, the 2021 edition of the classic text editor too-cool-for-school vibe.](https://github.com/austinbillings/killer-nova/raw/main/killer-nova.png)

KN employs crimson red, teal, gold, greys, and pale green to deliver a code-all-day experience with readability, class, and a touch of candy jungle badassery.

> Recommended fonts:
>    SF Mono, Monaco, Source Code Mono, or Noto Mono Sans

> For maximal code reading/writing pleasure, it's recommended you increase the editor line-height to 1.75x or greater. But that's just, like, my opinion, man.

Continuing the _Killer_ trend, this theme is not a port, but a reinvention for daily driver use. This year ('21), a new _Killer_ is borne via the inimitable *Nova* by Panic.

The original _Killer_ themes, for Firefox, Atom, & Sublime, are also by [AB](https://github.com/austinbillings), along with some other cool javascript libraries you might find useful.
